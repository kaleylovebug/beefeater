My project concerns corpus building in order to compare the syntax of AI responses and human responses to test questions. I utilized responses to ten questions from 4 human individuals. In gathering the AI responses, ChatGPT was used. Each question was asked to the AI, and its answer was regenerated twice for each question (creating a total of 3 AI responses per question). This information is represented in the key:

KEY:
